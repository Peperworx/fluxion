<p>Distributed actor framework written in Rust.</p>
</div>
<h1>About</h1>
<p>Fluxion is an actor framework designed with distributed systems in mind, namely sending messages not just between actors, but also between systems.</p>
<h2>Why Fluxion?</h2>
<p>Fluxion is designed for a very specific usecase: creating applications that require extremely flexible plugin solutions and communication between different running instances. If you do not need any of the specific features provided by Fluxion, you are probably best off using a different actor system. Internally, Fluxion is based upon <a href="https://github.com/peperworx/slacktor" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slacktor</a>, which provides a core actor framework and high-performance messaging solution. Slacktor was purpose built for  Fluxion, and is provided separately for higher-performance usecases, as well as those that do not need Fluxion's additional features.</p>
<h2>Core Features</h2>
<p>Fluxion embraces a few core features, and tries to keep an API that is as as simple and extensible as possible.</p>
<h3>No-Std Support</h3>
<p>Fluxion and its dependencies only depend on <code>core</code> and <code>alloc</code>. This means that Fluxion can be used in <code>no-std</code> environments, as long as an allocator is available.</p>
<h3>Executor Agnosticism</h3>
<p>Fluxion is structured such that it never needs to spawn any tasks. This means that Fluxion does not need to access any specific executor library and is completely executor agnostic with no boilerplate required. You can use Tokio, async_std, Smol, or even write your own executor and Fluxion will not care. In the provided examples, however, we do use Tokio, as it is the most popular executor.</p>
<h3>Foreign Messages</h3>
<p>Fluxion's core feature is being able to send messages between systems, and is conditional on the <code>foreign</code> feature. Fluxion accomplishes this by allowing the user to define a "delegate" that responds to requests for specific foreign actors. The delegate returns an implementor of a trait that enables sending messages of a specific type. If the <code>serde</code> feature is enabled, then messages will be required to implement serialization functionality to be treated as foreign messages.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>The best way to get started right now is to take a look at the <code>simple</code> example. It contains the most bare bones possible example for using Fluxion as an actor system with no special features. For more advanced usage, take a look at <a href="https://fluxion.peperworx.com/book/" rel="noopener noreferrer">the book</a>.</p>
