Distributed actor framework written in rust.
</div>



## About

Fluxion is an actor framework designed with distributed systems in mind, namely sending messages not just between actors, but also between systems.


## Usage

Fluxion's usage is rather complex at the moment. While a new crate that will simplify it greatly is planned, currently the best source for usage documentation is in `examples`. Extensive documentation is currently in the works.

Fluxion is Dual-Licensed under Apache 2.0 and MIT.
